RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission.  
RSA Public-Key Cryptosystem is implemented using **Karatsuba algorithm** and **C#**.  
The aim of this project is applying **Algorithms principles** and perform operations efficiently in terms of **time complexities** and **space complexities**.
